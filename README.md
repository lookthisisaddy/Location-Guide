# Location Guide
A simple android app to help tourist find nearby places like restaurants, hotels, ATMs and tourist attractions.

### Description
Similar to G-Maps, it uses device's GPS to show current location of the user. User can see list of places like restaurants, hotels, ATMs and tourist attractions within a radius set to 1.5 Km. and search any place within the country. Google Maps Platform APIs such as Places API and Directions API are used to get place details and its route respectively.
